description: "Learn how to securely handle real-time events from xPay using webhooks."
---

Webhooks allow you to stay informed about specific events in xPay by receiving real-time notifications. Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about setting up and handling webhooks securely and efficiently.

### Webhook URL

You will register an endpoint URL to receive events from xPay through the **[Settings Page](https://app.xpaycheckout.com/settings)**, where a `signing_key` will also be provided for securing the communication between xPay and your system. Make sure your webhook URL is set up to reliably accept these events and handle them as needed.

<Note>
  Please ensure that you register the webhook endpoint via the **[Settings Page](https://app.xpaycheckout.com/settings)** to receive event notifications. The `signing_key` required for verifying the events will also be provided there.
</Note>

### Timeouts

xPay's system will adhere to a **2-second** connection timeout and read timeout for each webhook delivery attempt. If the request exceeds this limit or fails for any reason, xPay will retry sending the event using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming your system.

### Idempotency

To ensure robustness in your webhook processing, it's crucial to handle events idempotently. This means that even if the same event is sent multiple times (due to retries), your system will handle it without causing errors or duplicating operations.

### Security

Each event payload will be signed using `HmacSHA512` with the provided `signing_key`. To verify the authenticity of the event, compute the HMAC of the payload and compare it with the `xpay-signature` header value to confirm that the event came from xPay.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(incomingSignature, payload, secret) {
    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret);
    hmac.update(payload);
    const generatedSignature = hmac.digest('base64');
    
    return incomingSignature === generatedSignature;
}

// Usage example
const incomingSignature = 'some-signature';
const payload = 'payload-data';
const secret = 'secret-key';
const isValid = verifySignature(incomingSignature, payload, secret);
console.log(isValid);
```

```java Java
private boolean verifySignature(String incomingSignature, String payload, String secret) throws Exception {
        Mac sha512Hmac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA512");
        SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(secret.getBytes("UTF-8"), "HmacSHA512");
        sha512Hmac.init(keySpec);
        byte[] macData = sha512Hmac.doFinal(payload.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        incomingSignature.equals(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(macData));
    }
```

```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64

def verify_signature(incoming_signature, payload, secret):
    # Create the HMAC-SHA512 signature
    mac = hmac.new(secret.encode('utf-8'), payload.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha512)
    generated_signature = base64.b64encode(mac.digest()).decode('utf-8')
    
    return incoming_signature == generated_signature

# Usage example
incoming_signature = 'some-signature'
payload = 'payload-data'
secret = 'secret-key'
is_valid = verify_signature(incoming_signature, payload, secret)
print(is_valid)
```

```rust Rust
// Add Dependencies in Cargo.toml
// [dependencies]
// hmac = "0.11"
// sha2 = "0.10"
// base64 = "0.13"

use hmac::{Hmac, Mac};
use sha2::Sha512;
use base64::{encode};

// Type alias for HMAC-SHA512
type HmacSha512 = Hmac<Sha512>;

fn verify_signature(incoming_signature: &str, payload: &str, secret: &str) -> bool {
    let mut mac = HmacSha512::new_from_slice(secret.as_bytes()).expect("HMAC can take key of any size");
    mac.update(payload.as_bytes());
    let result = mac.finalize();
    let generated_signature = encode(result.into_bytes());

    incoming_signature == generated_signature
}

// Usage example
fn main() {
    let incoming_signature = "some-signature";
    let payload = "payload-data";
    let secret = "secret-key";
    let is_valid = verify_signature(incoming_signature, payload, secret);
    println!("{}", is_valid);
}
```

### Sample Payload Header
```json
{
  "xpay-signature" : "s3z2v3ZGwMvDwiQ+9PpAT3WuSYU+PeSZJqvdzZXPmifAh3sT+s502PgJJx9NV4KQaScEaquTEuHJ30v17hK5GA==",
  ...
}
```

### Sample Payload Data
```json

  "eventId": "6717b96ba75cc81f88819e41",
  "eventType": "intent.success",
  "eventTime": 1729608043615,
  "intentId": "6717b96ba75cc81f88819e40",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Response Feilds

<ResponseField name="eventId" type="string"> A unique identifier for this specific event. This ensures that each event can be tracked and processed individually. </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="eventType" type="string"> Describes the type of event. In this case, it signifies that a payment intent has succeeded. </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="eventTime" type="integer"> The timestamp when the event was generated, typically in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). This value can be used to track when the event occurred. </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="intentId" type="string"> A unique identifier for the specific payment intent. This ID ties the event back to a particular transaction or payment process that triggered the event. </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="status" type="string"> Represents the current status of the payment intent. In this case, it indicates that the payment was successful. </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="amount" type="integer"> The amount involved in the transaction, typically expressed in the smallest unit of the currency. Here, 5000 represents 50.00 USD (because USD typically uses two decimal places). </ResponseField> <ResponseField name="currency" type="string"> The currency used for the transaction. In this case, it is United States Dollars (USD). </ResponseField>
