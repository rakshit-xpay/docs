## **Tech FAQs**

<Accordion title="How and where do I use the xPay Keys?">
We follow Basic Auth RFC for authentication.

In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding of `<xPay Public Key>` and `<xPay Private Key>` joined by a single colon `:`.

For a detailed explanation of how to use xPay keys, refer to the [Authentication Page](/api/authentication).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What value do I use in the amount field in API calls?">
  All values in the `amount` field must be in the smallest currency unit. For
  example: - If the transaction is in USD, 1 USD = 100 cents, so to charge USD
  2, you should set the amount to 200. - Similarly, for EUR, 1 EUR = 100 cents.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do if I receive a 400 Bad Request response?">
A 400 Bad Request error usually means there’s something wrong with the request. This can be due to:

- Incorrect parameters
- Missing required fields
- Issues with authentication or malformed data

Check your API call and ensure all required parameters are correct and properly formatted. Also, verify your xPay API keys and ensure they’re correctly included in the header.

For a more detailed description of error codes and troubleshooting tips, refer to the [Errors](/api/errors).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I integrate xPay with my platform?">
  You can integrate xPay with your platform using our well-documented API. The
  integration process includes authentication, creating a payment intent,
  handling the payment process, and confirming the payment. Refer to the [API
  Integration Guide](/integrations/architecture) for step-by-step details.
