To start integrating xPay into your platform, you first need to retrieve your API keys. These keys are essential for authenticating your requests and securely interacting with xPay’s services.

### Steps to Get Your Keys:

<Steps>
<Step title="Login to Your xPay Dashboard">
Navigate to [xPay Dashboard](https://app.xpaycheckout.com) and log in using your account credentials.
</Step>

<Step title="Access the Settings Section">
  Once logged in, go to the [Settings](https://app.xpaycheckout.com/settings) section, where you will find your API keys.
  If you have a test account, you’ll see Test Keys. For approved live accounts,
  your Live Keys will also be available.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Keys vs. Live Keys">
  - **Test Keys**: Use these during the integration phase to simulate payments
  and test your setup without processing real transactions. 
  - **Live Keys**:
  After your account is approved, these keys will allow you to accept real
  payments in production.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Never expose your API keys in your code or publicly.**  
For security purposes, always store your keys in your **environment variables**. Exposing your keys can compromise your xPay account and the security of your transactions.
</Warning>
