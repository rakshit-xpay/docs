<Steps>
    <Step title="Initiate Subscription Intent (Merchant Server → xPay Server)">
        Begin by making a **create subscription** POST request to xPay's API from the Merchant Server, which returns an `fwdUrl` for initiating the subscription process.
        See [Create Subscription API](/endpoint/xPayAPIs/create-subscription) for details.
        <Note>
            The **callbackUrl** in the **create subscription** request should be set to your client-side page that handles the redirect after a subscription attempt.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Receive Subscription Intent Confirmation (xPay Server → Merchant Server)">
        Once the subscription intent is created, the xPay Server responds with a `subscriptionId`. This identifier is crucial for tracking the status of the subscription.
        <Tip>Ensure that the Merchant Server logs or securely stores this identifier for further processing and verification.</Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Forward Intent Data to Merchant Frontend (Merchant Server → Merchant Frontend)">
        The Merchant Server should pass the `fwdUrl` along with the subscription details to the Merchant Frontend, preparing it to manage user interactions related to the subscription.
        <Info>Verify that the frontend is set up to handle the subscription initiation seamlessly.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirect to xPay Subscription Checkout (Merchant Frontend → xPay Client)">
        Use the `fwdUrl` to redirect users to xPay’s checkout page to complete the subscription.

        ```javascript JavaScript
        const redirectToSubscriptionCheckout = () => {
            const url = new URL(fwdUrl); // fwdUrl received from your server after creating a subscription intent
            window.open(url.href).focus();
        };
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle a Redirect on the callbackUrl (xPay Client → Merchant Frontend)">
        - Create a client-side page to handle the redirect and display the subscription status.
        - After the process, users will be redirected to the **callbackUrl** with the query parameter **subscription_id**.
        - The Merchant Frontend contacts the Merchant Server, which invokes the **Get Subscription** GET request to fetch the status and metadata for the specified intent. See [Get Subscription API](/endpoint/xPayAPIs/get-subscription) for details.

        ```javascript JavaScript
        const onSubscriptionPageLoad = async () => {
            const url = new URL(window.location.href);
            const subscriptionId = url.searchParams.get("subscription_id");

            const subscriptionIntent = await getSubscriptionIntentStatus(subscriptionId, metadata); // From the Merchant Server
            if(subscriptionIntent.status === "ACTIVE") {
                // redirect to your subscription success page
            } else {
                // redirect to your subscription failure page
            }
        };
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
