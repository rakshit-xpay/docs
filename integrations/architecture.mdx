### xPay Payment Flow Architecture

This diagram illustrates the integration flow for processing payments through xPay. The architecture involves three key components: the **Merchant Server**, **Merchant Frontend**, and **xPay’s Server and Client systems**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the payment process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Intent (Merchant Server → xPay Server)">
    The payment process begins when the Merchant Server initiates a request to
    the xPay Server to create a payment intent. This intent encapsulates the
    necessary details for the payment, such as the amount, currency, and other
    transaction metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Payment Intent (xPay Server → Merchant Server)">
    Once the payment intent is successfully created, the xPay Server responds to
    the Merchant Server with a unique identifier for the payment, known as the
    xIntentId. This identifier will be used to track the payment throughout the
    process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Forward Intent ID (Merchant Server → Merchant Frontend)">
    The Merchant Server forwards the xIntentId to the Merchant Frontend, which
    is responsible for managing the user interface that initiates the payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to xPay Client (Merchant Frontend → xPay Client)">
    Upon user interaction (e.g., clicking "Pay Now"), the Merchant Frontend
    redirects the customer to the xPay Client along with the xIntentId. This
    redirection allows xPay to handle the actual payment process, presenting the
    user with various payment options and methods.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Payment & Return Metadata (xPay Client → Merchant Frontend)">
    After the payment is processed, the xPay Client redirects the user back to
    the Merchant Frontend, providing the payment status and any relevant
    metadata (such as transaction details and confirmation). This ensures the
    merchant is updated with the final outcome of the payment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Components

- **Merchant Server**: Handles backend operations like creating payment intents and processing the xIntentId received from xPay.
- **Merchant Frontend**: Manages the user interface, enabling users to initiate payments and receive feedback on the payment status.
- **xPay Server**: Responsible for generating the payment intent and returning the xIntentId to the Merchant Server.
- **xPay Client**: Manages the user’s payment journey, providing them with payment options and returning transaction metadata after payment processing.

This flow ensures a smooth, secure, and efficient integration for handling payments via xPay, with minimal friction on the user’s end. Each step is designed to maintain clarity, streamline transaction handling, and facilitate a seamless experience for both developers and users.
