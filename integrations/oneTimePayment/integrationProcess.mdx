<Steps>
    <Step title="Initiate Payment Intent (Merchant Server → xPay Server)">
        Start the transaction by making a **create-intent** POST request to xPay's API from the Merchant Server, which returns an `fwdUrl` in the response. 
        See [create-intent API](/endpoint/xPayAPIs/create-intent) for details.
        <Note>
            The **callbackUrl** string in the **create-intent** request should be configured to your client-side page responsible for managing the redirect from xPay checkout following a payment attempt.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Receive Payment Intent Confirmation (xPay Server → Merchant Server)">
        Once the payment intent is created, the xPay Server will respond with an `xIntentId`, which is used to track the payment status throughout the transaction.
        <Tip>The Merchant Server should log or store this identifier for future reference.</Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Forward Intent data to Merchant Frontend (Merchant Server → Merchant Frontend)">
        The Merchant Server forwards the intent data with `fwdUrl` to the Merchant Frontend, enabling it to manage user interactions related to the payment.
        <Info>Ensure the frontend is ready to handle the payment initiation process.</Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Redirect to xPay Checkout (Merchant Frontend → xPay Client)">
        Redirect the user to xPay’s checkout page to initiate the payment using the `fwdUrl`.

        ```javascript JavaScript
        const redirectToCheckout = () => {
            const url = new URL(fwdUrl); // fwdUrl received from your server after creating an intent
            window.open(url.href).focus();
        };
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle a Redirect on the callbackUrl (xPay Client → Merchant Frontend)">
        - Build a client-side page to receive the redirect and show the payment status.
        - After the payment process, customers will be redirected to the **callbackUrl** with the query parameter **xpay_intent_id**.
        - The Merchant Frontend contacts the Merchant Server, which invokes the **get-intent** GET request to retrieve the status and other metadata for the specified intent. See [get-intent API](/endpoint/xPayAPIs/get-intent) for details.

        ```javascript JavaScript
        const onPageLoad = async () => {
            const url = new URL(window.location.href);
            const intentId = url.searchParams.get("xpay_intent_id");

            const intent = await getIntentStatus(intentId, metadata); // From the Merchant Server
            if(intent.status === "SUCCESS") {
                // redirect to your payment success page
            } else {
                // redirect to your payment failure page
            }
        };
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
