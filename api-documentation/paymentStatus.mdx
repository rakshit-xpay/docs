title: Payment Statuses
---

The **xIntentId** tracks the lifecycle of a payment intent. Below is a table outlining the different statuses that an **xIntentId** can have during the payment process and what each status indicates.

---

| **Status**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATED`   | The payment intent has been successfully created, but no payment has been initiated yet.                                                           |
| `INCOMPLETE` | The payment process was started, but it wasn't completed successfully (e.g., user abandoned the payment or there was an issue).                     |
| `SUCCESS`     | The payment was processed successfully, and the transaction is complete.                                                                           |
| `FAILED`    | The payment attempt failed due to various possible reasons (e.g., insufficient funds, declined by the issuer, or a technical error).               |
| `REFUNDED`    | The payment was processed successfully but has since been refunded, either partially or fully, based on merchant or customer request.              |
| `DISPUTED`    | The payment is under dispute, meaning the customer or merchant has raised a concern regarding the transaction, often leading to a chargeback claim. |
| `DISPUTE_WON` | The dispute was resolved in favor of the merchant, meaning the chargeback claim has been settled successfully, and the funds remain with the merchant. |
