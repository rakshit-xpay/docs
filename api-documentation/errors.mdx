xPay uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range signify success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate client-side errors based on the information provided. Codes in the `5xx` range indicate errors related to xPay's servers.

**Below is the list of HTTP status codes**
| Code       | Reason               | Potential Root Cause                                                                 |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200`      | Request is OK        | The request was successfully received and processed.                                 |
| `400`      | Bad Request          | There’s something wrong about the request. Potentially incorrect parameters, insufficient parameters, or an issue with authentication. |
| `401`      | Unauthorized         | You do not have access to the requested resource or your API keys are incorrect.      |
| `404`      | Resource Not Found   | You’re likely hitting the wrong endpoint or the resource does not exist.              |
| `500`      | Internal Server Error| Likely a server-side issue on xPay’s side.                                           |

Most errors in xPay will include an error code that can be used to handle the issue programmatically, along with a description that explains the reported problem.

## Attributes of the error object

Example error object: 
```json HTTP Status Code: 500
{
  "errorCode": "internal_server_error",
  "errorDescription": "An unexpected error occurred on the server."
}
```

<ParamField path="errorCode" type="string">

## Error codes 
Below is a list of error codes that xPay may return in the `errorCode` field, along with information on how to resolve them.

| Error Code              | Description                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `internal_server_error` | Indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
| `bad_request`           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).  |
| `resource_not_found`    | The server can't find the requested resource, which could mean the URL is incorrect or the resource has been removed. |
| `unauthorized`          | The request requires user authentication. If the request lacks valid authentication credentials, the server responds with this error. |
