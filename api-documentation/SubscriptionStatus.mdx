Below are the various subscription statuses that you may encounter when managing subscriptions on the xPay platform:

| **Status**    | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CREATED`   | The subscription has been created, but the first payment has not yet been processed.                  |
| `INCOMPLETE`| The subscription creation process is incomplete, possibly due to no payment method being attached.            |
| `ACTIVE`    | The subscription is currently active and recurring payments are being processed as per the schedule.  |
| `INACTIVE`  | The subscription is inactive, usually due to payment failures or being blocked by the customer.        |
| `CANCELLED` | The subscription has been cancelled by the merchant or customer, and no further payments will be processed. |

These statuses help in tracking the lifecycle of a subscription from creation to cancellation or inactivity.
