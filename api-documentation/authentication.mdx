description: "Authentication with xPay — Basic Authentication (RFC 7617)"
---

At xPay, we follow the Basic Auth RFC (RFC 7617) standard for authenticating requests made to our API. This ensures secure and straightforward access to the platform.

## How Basic Authentication Works

<RequestExample>

```javascript Node.js
const createHeaders = (username, password) => {
  const auth = `${username}:${password}`;
  const encodedAuth = Buffer.from(auth).toString("base64");
  return {
    Authorization: `Basic ${encodedAuth}`,
  };
};

// Usage
const headers = createHeaders("<xPay Public Key>", "<xPay Private Key>");
console.log(headers);

// Never expose your API keys in your code or publicly.
// For security purposes, always store your keys in your environment variables.
// Exposing your keys can compromise your xPay account and the security of your transactions.

// The axios library is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Node.js and supports Basic Authentication natively.
```

```java Java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;

public class AuthUtils {

    public static HttpHeaders createHeaders(String username, String password) {
        String auth = username + ":" + password;
        byte[] encodedAuth = Base64.getEncoder().encode(auth.getBytes(StandardCharsets.US_ASCII));
        String authHeader = "Basic " + new String(encodedAuth);

        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.set("Authorization", authHeader);
        return headers;
    }

    // Usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HttpHeaders headers = createHeaders("<xPay Public Key>", "<xPay Private Key>");
        System.out.println(headers);
    }
}

// Never expose your API keys in your code or publicly.
// For security purposes, always store your keys in your environment variables.
// Exposing your keys can compromise your xPay account and the security of your transactions.

// The Apache HttpClient is a good choice for making HTTP requests in Java and it supports Basic Authentication natively.
```

```python Python
import base64

def create_headers(username, password):
  auth = f"{username}:{password}"
  encoded_auth = base64.b64encode(auth.encode('ascii')).decode('ascii')
  headers = {
      'Authorization': f"Basic {encoded_auth}"
  }
  return headers

# Usage
headers = create_headers("<xPay Public Key>", "<xPay Private Key>")
print(headers)

# Never expose your API keys in your code or publicly.
# For security purposes, always store your keys in your environment variables.
# Exposing your keys can compromise your xPay account and the security of your transactions.

# The requests library is the most commonly used for making HTTP requests in Python and supports Basic Authentication natively.
```

```rust Rust
// First, make sure to include the `base64` crate in your `Cargo.toml`
// [dependencies]
// base64 = "0.13.0"

use base64::encode;
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn create_headers(username: &str, password: &str) -> HashMap<String, String> {
    let auth = format!("{}:{}", username, password);
    let encoded_auth = encode(auth);
    let mut headers = HashMap::new();
    headers.insert("Authorization".to_string(), format!("Basic {}", encoded_auth));
    headers
}

// Usage
fn main() {
    let headers = create_headers("<xPay Public Key>", "<xPay Private Key>");
    println!("{:?}", headers);
}

// Never expose your API keys in your code or publicly.
// For security purposes, always store your keys in your environment variables.
// Exposing your keys can compromise your xPay account and the security of your transactions.

// The reqwest library is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Rust and supports Basic Authentication natively.
```

</RequestExample>

In Basic HTTP Authentication, your request will contain an Authorization header with the following format:

```http
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```

Where `<credentials>` represents your xPay authentication details — specifically, your **xPay Public Key** and **xPay Private Key**. These are combined and Base64 encoded for transmission:

<Tip>
  Go through [Get Your Keys](/integrations/getyourkeys) document to obtain your
  xPay authentication keys.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Combine Public and Private Keys">
    Combine the **xPay Public Key** and **xPay Private Key** with a colon `:` separating them, forming this string:`<xPay Public Key>:<xPay Private Key>`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encode Credentials Using Base64" />
  <Step title="Add the Authorization Header">
  Send the encoded credentials as part of your API request's **Authorization** header.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For example, a typical Authorization header would look like:

```http
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

<Note>
  This Base64-encoded string represents the combination of username:password, in
  your case, the xPay Public Key and xPay Private Key.
</Note>

## Using Postman for API Authentication

To simulate API requests using Postman, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Basic Auth in Postman">
    Navigate to the **Authorization** tab in Postman. Under the Type dropdown,
    select **Basic Auth**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    - In the **Username** field, enter your **xPay Public Key**. - In the
    **Password** field, enter your **xPay Private Key**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Postman will automatically handle the Base64 encoding and include the Authorization header in your requests.
