description: "Authentication with xPay — Basic Authentication (RFC 7617)"
---

At xPay, we follow the Basic Auth RFC (RFC 7617) standard for authenticating requests made to our API. This ensures secure and straightforward access to the platform.

## How Basic Authentication Works

In Basic HTTP Authentication, your request will contain an Authorization header with the following format:

```http
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
```

Where `<credentials>` represents your xPay authentication details — specifically, your **xPay Public Key** and **xPay Private Key**. These are combined and Base64 encoded for transmission:

<Tip>Go through [Get Your Keys](/integrations/getyourkeys) document to obtain your xPay authentication keys.</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Combine Public and Private Keys">
    Combine the **xPay Public Key** and **xPay Private Key** with a colon `:` separating them, forming this string:`<xPay Public Key>:<xPay Private Key>`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encode Credentials Using Base64" />
  <Step title="Add the Authorization Header">
  Send the encoded credentials as part of your API request's **Authorization** header.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For example, a typical Authorization header would look like:

```http
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

<Note>
  This Base64-encoded string represents the combination of username:password, in
  your case, the xPay Public Key and xPay Private Key.
</Note>

## Using Postman for API Authentication

To simulate API requests using Postman, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Basic Auth in Postman">
    Navigate to the **Authorization** tab in Postman. 
    Under the Type dropdown, select **Basic Auth**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Credentials">
    - In the **Username** field, enter your **xPay Public Key**. 
    - In the **Password** field, enter your **xPay Private Key**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Postman will automatically handle the Base64 encoding and include the Authorization header in your requests.
